# Haskell
1. **Who likes it?**
You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.
Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:
```hs
[]                                -->  "no one likes this"
["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
["Jacob", "Alex"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
["Max", "John", "Mark"]           -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
```
Note: For 4 or more names, the number in "and 2 others" simply increases.
```hs
module Likes where

likes :: [String] -> String
-- TODO
likes [] = "no one likes this"
likes [x] = x ++ " likes this"
likes [x, y] = x ++ " and " ++ y ++ " like this"
likes [x,y,z] = x ++ ", " ++ y ++ " and " ++ z ++ " like this"
likes (x:y:rest) = x ++ ", " ++ y ++ " and " ++ show (length rest) ++ " others like this"
```
2. **Credit Card Mask**
Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct. However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.

Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.
```hs
module Maskify where

maskify :: String -> String
maskify str 
 | l >= 4 = replicate (l - 4) '#' ++ drop (l - 4) str
 | otherwise = str
 where l = length str

-- Recursivo
module Maskify where

maskify :: String -> String
maskify [] = []
maskify l@(x:xs) = (if (length l > 4) then '#' else x) : maskify xs
```
3. **Split Strings**
Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').
```hs
solution :: String -> [String]
solution [] = []
solution [x] = [x : "_"]
solution (a:b:xs) = [a, b] : solution xs
```
4. **Create Phone Number**
Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.
Example
```hs
createPhoneNumber [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0] -- => returns "(123) 456-7890"
```
The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.
Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!
```hs
createPhoneNumber :: [Int] -> String
createPhoneNumber (x:y:z:a:b:c:f) = "(" ++ concatMap show [x,y,z] ++ ")" ++ " " ++ concatMap show [a,b,c] ++ "-" ++ concatMap show f
```
5. **Isograms**
An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.
Example: (Input --> Output)
```hs
"Dermatoglyphics" --> true "aba" --> false "moOse" --> false (ignore letter case)

isIsogram "Dermatoglyphics" = true
isIsogram "moose" = false
isIsogram "aba" = false
```
```hs
module Isogram where
import Data.Char (toLower)

isIsogram :: String -> Bool
isIsogram [] = True
isIsogram (x:xs) = if (contiene x xs) then False else isIsogram xs

contiene :: Char -> [Char] -> Bool
contiene a [] = False
contiene a (x:xs) = (toLower a == toLower x) || contiene a xs
```
Random code
```hs
module Isogram where

import Data.Char
import Data.List

isIsogram :: String -> Bool
isIsogram x = y == nub y
  where y = map toLower x
```
6. **Delete occurrences of an element if it occurs more than n times**
Enough is enough!

Alice and Bob were on a holiday. Both of them took many pictures of the places they've been, and now they want to show Charlie their entire collection. However, Charlie doesn't like these sessions, since the motif usually repeats. He isn't fond of seeing the Eiffel tower 40 times.
He tells them that he will only sit for the session if they show the same motif at most N times. Luckily, Alice and Bob are able to encode the motif as a number. Can you help them to remove numbers such that their list contains each number only up to N times, without changing the order?
Task

Given a list and a number, create a new list that contains each number of list at most N times, without reordering.
For example if the input number is 2, and the input list is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].
With list [20,37,20,21] and number 1, the result would be [20,37,21].
```hs
module Codewars.Kata.Deletion where
import Data.List (nub)

deleteNth :: [Int] -> Int -> [Int]
deleteNth [] _ = []
deleteNth lst 1 = nub lst
deleteNth (x:xs) n = si ++ deleteNth xs n
 where
  si = if (numApariciones x xs < n) then [x] else []

numApariciones :: Int -> [Int] -> Int
numApariciones elem [] = 0
numApariciones elem (x:xs) = cabezaIgual + numApariciones elem xs
 where
  cabezaIgual = if (elem == x) then 1 else 0
```
Random code 
```hs
deleteNth :: [Int] -> Int -> [Int]
deleteNth lst n = foldl f [] lst
  where f acc x = if length (filter (==x) acc) >= n then acc else acc ++ [x]
```

1. **Multiples of 3 or 5**
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.
Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.
Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.
```js
function solution(number){
    if (number < 0)
	return 0;
    var sum = 0;
    number--;
    while(number > 0) {
	if((number % 3) == 0 || (number % 5) == 0) {
	    sum += number;
	}
	number -= 1;
    }
    // for (let i = 1; i < number; i++) {
    // 	if ((i % 3) == 0 || (i % 5) == 0) {
    // 	    sum += i;
    // 	}
    // }
    return sum;
}
```
